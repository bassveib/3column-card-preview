## My process

I created a flexbox div container with 3 items inside, after giving al the necessesary styles a used media query to change the size for a mobile display.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

This is my first project after learning about Flexbox, now I feel more confident with. Unfortunately I couldn't put the "onclick" on the buttons because I don't know how to do it yet.
